The text is notable for providing one of earliest known definition of a Purana genre of literature.[7] A history written with five characteristics is called a Purana, states Matsya Purana, otherwise it is called Akhyana.[7] These five characteristics are cosmogony describing its theory of primary creation of the universe, chronological description of secondary creations wherein the universe goes through the cycle of birth-life-death, genealogy and mythology of gods and goddesses, Manvantaras, legends of kings and people including solar and lunar dynasties.[8]

The Matsya Purana is also notable for being encyclopedic in the topics it covers.[9] Along with the five topics the text defines a Purana to be, it includes mythology, a guide for building art work such as paintings and sculpture, features and design guidelines for temples, objects and house architecture (Vastu-shastra), various types of Yoga, duties and ethics (Dharma) with multiple chapters on the value of DƒÅna (charity), both Shiva and Vishnu related festivals, geography particularly around the Narmada river, pilgrimage, duties of a king and good government and other topics.
