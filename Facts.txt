The Matsya Purana (IAST: Matsya Purāṇa) is one of the eighteen major Puranas (Mahapurana), and among the oldest and better preserved in the Puranic genre of Sanskrit literature in Hinduism.[1][2] The text is a Vaishnavism text named after the half-human and half-fish avatar of Vishnu.[1][3] However, the text has been called by the 19th-century Sanskrit scholar Horace Hayman Wilson, "although a Shaivism (Shiva-related) work, it is not exclusively so"; the text has also been referred to one that simultaneously praises various Hindu gods and goddesses.[4][5]

The Matsya Purana has survived into the modern era in many versions, varying in the details but almost all of the published versions have 291 chapters,[6] except the Tamil language version, written in Grantha script, which has 172 chapters.
