The text is named after the fish avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu called Matsya.[1][16]

The Tamil version of the Matsya Purana has two sections, Purva (early) and Uttara (later), and it consists of 172 chapters.[4][17] Other versions of the published Matsya Purana manuscripts have 291 chapters.[6]

The text and tradition asserts that Matsya Purana had 20,000 verses.[1] However, extant manuscripts contain between 13,000 and 15,000 verses.[1]

The Padma Purana categorizes Matsya Purana as a Tamas Purana,[18] or one that glorifies Shiva or Agni.[7] Scholars consider the Sattva-Rajas-Tamas classification as "entirely fanciful" and there is nothing in this text that actually justifies this classification.
